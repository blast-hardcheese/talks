Type refinement:
  + Describes meaning, not just shape
  - More stringent API, can't just pass whatever

Type classes:
  + Powerful extensibility
  - One giant method == Single Point of Truth

Validation:
  + Compositional error handling
  - Tracing through validation if/else chains add billable hours
